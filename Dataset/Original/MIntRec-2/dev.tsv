990	7	there are a number of options and.... i'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air-flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.	Explain	00:12:56,942	00:13:07,118	bigbang	Sheldon
990	8	why don't you pick at random, if you don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?	Advise	00:13:07,286	00:13:11,039	bigbang	Penny

990	12	well, i suppose so.	Agree	00:13:29,225	00:13:30,475	bigbang	Sheldon
990	13	leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with.	Inform	00:13:45,825	00:13:49,285	bigbang	Sheldon
990	14	would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?	Asking for opinions	00:13:50,204	00:13:53,081	bigbang	Sheldon

990	19	but on the other hand if things don't go well with leonard, i risk losing a really good friend.	Explain	00:14:09,640	00:14:14,435	bigbang	Penny
990	20	i mean, he's not looking for a fling.	Explain	00:14:14,603	00:14:16,354	bigbang	Penny
990	21	i would not say that.	Oppose	00:14:20,651	00:14:21,776	bigbang	Sheldon

990	33	sorry, you diverted me.	Apologise	00:15:16,415	00:15:17,665	bigbang	Sheldon
990	34	anyway, in 1935, erwin schrödinger, in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment.	Introduce	00:15:17,833	00:15:26,090	bigbang	Sheldon
990	35	a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time.	Introduce	00:15:26,258	00:15:31,971	bigbang	Sheldon
990	36	now, since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.	Introduce	00:15:32,139	00:15:41,606	bigbang	Sheldon
990	37	i'm sorry, i don't get the point.	Apologise	00:15:46,654	00:15:48,196	bigbang	Penny
