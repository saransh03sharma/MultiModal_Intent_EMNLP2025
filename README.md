# Text Takes Over: A Study of Modality Bias in Multimodal Intent Detection

## Overview

**MultiModal_Intent_EMNLP2025** is the official code and dataset repository for the EMNLP 2025 main conference paper:

**“Text Takes Over: A Study of Modality Bias in Multimodal Intent Detection.”**  
📄 [Read the paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16122v1)

This project investigates **intent recognition using multimodal data** (text, audio, and video) and presents a systematic study of **modality bias** in existing datasets and models. The repository contains datasets, experimental pipelines, and scripts required to **reproduce, analyze, and extend** the findings of the paper.

## Features

* 💡 **Research Contribution**: Codebase for the EMNLP 2025 paper *“Text Takes Over: A Study of Modality Bias in Multimodal Intent Detection.”*
* 📂 **Datasets Included**:

  * Original datasets from **MIntRec-1** and **MIntRec 2.0**.
  * **Debiased variants** created after Phase-3 of our study.
  * **Automated annotation variant** generated after Phase-2.
* ⚙️ **Experimental Pipelines**:

  * `Phase-1/` contains scripts for reproducing baseline experiments.
  * Instructions provided for evaluating **different categories of models** (LLMs, multimodal encoders, text-only baselines, etc.).
  * `Phase-2.md` and `Phase-3.md` contain instructions for downloading the codebases for Phase-2 and Phase-3 experiments and reproducing the results.

## Dataset

The `Dataset/` folder provides:

* **Original**: Original dataset files provided by the authors of MIntRec-1 and 2.0. (Kindly follow their GitHub repositories for downloading raw `.mp4` video files and audio feature `.pkl` files.)
* **Debiased**: Debiased variant of the original datasets. This is obtained by carefully filtering as part of Phase-3 of our study. We encourage all future researchers to also test their proposed solutions on debiased variants to ensure their models perform well and are not simply text-based models in disguise.
* **Phase-2-Automated\_Annotation**: We provide the raw CSVs of the 7 variants of masking used during Phase-2 of our study. Each CSV contains labels predicted by the corresponding masking variant (e.g., `sdif_bert_text.csv` means that apart from text, both video and audio are masked), along with the output probability corresponding to the ground label.
* **Human-Annotation**: We also provide human annotated dataset files for future exploration in training of routers.
